# Brandywine Bridge Ethereum Smart Contracts

We are building a bridge that is powered by Chainlink to allow individuals to build out dApps with our solution that would allow their applications to utilize the power of both blockchains (ETHEREUM & ELROND).


## Multisig SC
We want to implement a multisig SC for minting and creating the wrapped tokens. The multisig should be integrated into how the governance of the bridge ecosystem works. Stakers should be approvers?

## Staking SC
Chainlink tokens are requiered in the chainlink bridge contract to cover the EA fee. We want to implement a reward program for individuals who provide token liquidity.
